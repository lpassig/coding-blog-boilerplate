> German Angst or conservative innovation and its role in the Cloud Adoption!

# Intro 

I often notice people working in the IT sector criticizing Germans or German companies for a lack of innovation. A perfect example of this perception is notable in the current discussions regarding the 5G network expansion plans of the German Government. 

These discussions often result in quite heated and negative feedback in the comment sections of German newspapers or on social media in general. German companies or the German Government for that matter, are often considered slow and extremely cautious when it comes to innovation or adoption of new technology or processes. To put it in the words of **Tomasz Mroczkowski**<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>: 

>*“The country that invented the ‘triple-helix’, today is criticized for insufficient entrepreneurship and innovation, and for coddling university academics who are described as conservative, inward-looking, and resistant to change”*<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>

However, I want to shine another light on this topic that mostly has a negative connotation attached to it and give another perspective.

# My perspective

This perception of Germany as a state that is lagging behind in the field of technology and innovation has become a turned from an ephemeral joke to a prevalent idea spanning across fields. Moreover, the normative idea of innovation is rarely questioned. It has become an answer, a buzzword and almost a knee-jerk reaction to most policy issues. But it begs the question: what problem are we solving through *“innovation”*? And is innovation and the amount of resources needed for it really ALWAYS the most optimal answer to issues faced by our businesses? 

## The roots 
One of the earliest references of the term “German Angst” or more precisely “West Germany: **Moment of Angst**“ can be found on the frontpage of the TIME MAGAZIN published in 1981. 

Within the context of the society there, it was used to describe not just a feeling but was in fact a reference of the political and socio-economic climate, that was reigning in the German society. Germans seemed to fear a lot of things, existential dread being one of them as well as the perpetual risk of a nuclear war during the cold war era.

![Time Magazin Titel Cover](/img/time_german_angst.jpg)
Title: *West Germany: Moment of Angst*
 
Now the term is widely spread across industries and can be used as a synonym for something that is *“typically German”*. Meaning, being first and foremost: cautious, scared and critical of anything *“new”*.

While German Angst is more related to sociology issues, the current trend of German innovation can be better described as **conservative innovation**. 

This term was only recently characterized by (amongst others) **Sebastian Pfotenhauer**<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> Professor at the Technical University Munich (TUM) School of Management and Munich Center for Technology in Society (MCTS).

In multiple congress contributions<sup id="a4">[4](#f4)</sup> he explained conservative innovation as an approach of:

> *“...**preserving traditional socio-economic orders** rather than disrupting them; to **favor and safeguard political and economic incumbents** rather than enable new entrants; and to **act from a perceived position of strength** or even saturation rather than decline or emergency. Moreover, Bavaria innovates **ignoring or even rejecting integrative European techno-politics.**”*

## The doomsday argument

However, this is not a phenomenon limited to Bavaria, is its rather a trend across all German Companies. Especially in the manufacturing sector (Mainly based in the south of Germany) such a trend is visible, since they operate out of **position of strength** as mentioned before:

![Katapult Magazin](/img/katapult_bw.jpg)
Title: *Countries and Federal states with less economic performance than Baden-Wuerttemberg.*<sup id="a5">[5](#f5)</sup> 

This leads to a slow adoption rate of new “innovative” technology such as “Cloud Computing”. Those companies tend to fear the consequences in the socio-economic order and rather like to be in the second adoption “wave”, after the initial problems/questions are already solved. However, by acting like that **these companies might lose an important time** in the market disruption battle. 

To quote **C. William Pollard**<sup id="a6">[6](#f6)</sup> form his book *The Soul of the Firm*:

> *“Learning and innovation go hand in hand. The arrogance of success is to think that what you did yesterday will be sufficient for tomorrow.”*
 
# The light in the dark 
If you stopped reading after the first part, it might seems like that all is lost for big enterprises if they continue what they do, since they are stuck in an *“conservative innovation”* bubble. However, there is another side to that story.

Whilst innovation and disruption are almost always considered *“cool”* and some people (mostly people working in technical fields) cannot wait to jump on the bandwagon, there is also a darker side to this approach.

There are certain topics in innovation and disruption initiatives that almost nobody talks about: 

*<center><blockquote>Privacy and Security!</center></blockquote>*

Look at the following examples: 

1. Public Safety: 
   1. 5 G paper – 180 Scientists against it https://www.jrseco.com/european-union-5g-appeal-scientists-warn-of-potential-serious-health-effects-of-5g/, Swisscom patent from 2004 REDUCTION OF ELECTROSMOG IN WIRELESS LOCAL NETWORKS, WO/2004/075583
   
   2. Cameras in public spaces: 
    https://www.sscqueens.org/projects/scan/faqs#one (Racial Profiling, Crime Rate)

3.	Capitol One used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host some of their applications. Which can be considered a quite innovative in the financial sector. However, they have misconfigured the certain parts<sup id="a7">[7](#f7)</sup>, which allowed a hacker to gain entry. This resulted in personal data of 106 million customers in the US and Canada being exposed, who had applied for credit cards. 

4.	Tesla uses around eight cameras in order to deliver on of their flagship features *“autopilot”*. But do you want to get filmed and potentially analyzed while walking on the street next to a Tesla? Do you want innovation on the back of privacy by gaining as much data as possible?

    >*"While car owners have the option to opt out of sharing these video clips or private location data, bystanders captured in these videos have no say in how footage of them will be used, and are typically not even aware that they’re being documented."*<sup id="a8">[8](#f8)</sup>

There are great minds out there, that can summarize certain aspects of the dilemma brilliantly:

>**If data is the new oil, data breaches should be treated like oil spills**<sup id="a9">[9](#f9)</sup>

# What can we all learn from it?
We need to pause a bit more and engage with the technology not only from a technical perspective but also its socio-economic impact. What are the potential futures that could arise if this technology was widely adopted? Through creating these scenarios and consequently the world we envision, we can leverage the technology to reach the desirable futures  that we want.

## So what is the potential of Cloud computing? 

For simplicity lets have a look at most extreme scenarios have a look at an utopian scenario and one that can be described as doomsday...

TBD

# Closing 

When it comes to technology (Cloud Computing included) and the quick adoption of it. With a trustworthy and well aware partner and certified cloud provider on the side German companies are still able to deliver innovative products. But the timeline might shift slightly more into the future. 

This among other reasons is why cloud adoption in Germany is/was slower compared to other countries. The “German Angst” is very real, but it has the right to be there. Being a cautious, a little scared and critical of anything new, might even help German companies to deliver better and more secure products in the future! 

Coming to an end, it is possible to innovate in Germany, but the market is more cautious than in other countries which can be a strength for consumers in general. Conservative Innovation is real and if you work in tech, you are in the middle of it!

Let me know your thoughts!

Cheers!
